# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
refactor: updating production code 

In this project we will gather, assess and clean data. There will be visualization and analysis to help us reach to the best form of completing this project. The data will be prvided offline from Udacity, because there is not enough time for me to contact Twitter.
